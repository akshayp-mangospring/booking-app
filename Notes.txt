Whenever we are printing formatted strings, we have to specify the placeholder type in which our variable/constant will be printed. Some of the most used placeholders are:
%T - Type
%v - Value
%d - Integer
%s - String
We mostly use these placeholders in "fmt" package functions like Sprintf, Printf, etc.

We can think of Pointers as cross functional variables as well. Otherwise we would have to pass args to functions all the time. Thus we also call Pointers as Pass by Reference in contrast to other variables as Pass by Value.
