Whenever we are printing formatted strings, we have to specify the placeholder type in which our variable/constant will be printed. Some of the most used placeholders are:
%T - Type
%v - Value
%d - Integer
%s - String
We mostly use these placeholders in "fmt" package functions like Sprintf, Printf, etc.
