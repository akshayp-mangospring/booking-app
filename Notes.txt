Whenever we are printing formatted strings, we have to specify the placeholder type in which our variable/constant will be printed. Some of the most used placeholders are:
%T - Type
%v - Value
%d - Integer
%s - String
We mostly use these placeholders in "fmt" package functions like Sprintf, Printf, etc.

We can think of Pointers as cross functional variables as well. Otherwise we would have to pass args to functions all the time. Thus we also call Pointers as Pass by Reference in contrast to other variables as Pass by Value.

Go gives an error for unused variables, but doesn't give an error for unused functions. It's strange. But we have to keep track of unused functions.
Similar to JS - variables, consts are not hoisted in Go, but functions are.
Btw, the Code editor is so much helpful in writing Go programs. It shows errors, improvements instantly. It works like a charm.

Just like package level functions we can also have package level variables & constants as well. But local variables are much more preferred, it helps in quicker garbage collection.
Just like we can export functions we can also export constants, or variables outside a package and make it Global in scope, by just capitalising the first letter of the var/const.

Maps in Go are basically a way to store key:value data. But the types of keys or values need to be all the same.
E.g.: map[string]int creates a Map of string keys and int values. All keys need to have string datatype. All values need to have int datatype.
A shortcoming of Maps is that we can't mix datatypes of each key or each value. We can't mix them.
In such cases we can use Structs. We can mix datatypes, even attach methods on a Struct to access/modify data of that Struct.
